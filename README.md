# tweet-sentiment-predictor

# Description

We will use datasets to create a model with (various) features that will predict whether a tweet is positive, neutral, or negative. Using Pandas, AWS, HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap, Keras, TensorFlow, Pyspark and NLP they will be ranked and weighted to see which way they get classified.
