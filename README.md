##Major Tasks:
classifies  text (tweets) as positive or negitive 

## project overview  

# Description

We will use datasets to create a model with (various) features that will predict whether a tweet is positive or negative. Using Pandas, AWS, HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap, and NLTK they will be ranked and weighted to see which way they get classified.

# Results:

After training and testing is concluded, there should be two Models that can formulate Predictions with the "SGD Model" and "Logical model". These are able to identify positive and negative tweets from a dataset. This model can be used with new information and can make a  determination on new entered  tweets and decide if the tweet is positive or negative with increasing levels of accuracy. The models can now be used with any new tweets collected  in the future for farther development.
